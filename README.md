## About the Book
Kotlin Crash Course is a fast-paced, hands-on introduction to Kotlin, preparing readers to build robust applications efficiently using the latest language features and best practices.

The book is divided into comprehensive chapters that cover key Kotlin programming topics such as object-oriented and functional programming, collections, concurrency, and unit testing. Each chapter takes a learning by doing approach, focusing on practical projects rather than solely theoretical knowledge. This strategy improves knowledge retention by simulating real-life experiences, allowing students to apply concepts in practice as they learn them. Furthermore, the book is interwoven with an abundance of best practices obtained from industry experience. This approach ensures that even beginners can gain seasoned insights and apply their knowledge confidently to real-world challenges.
